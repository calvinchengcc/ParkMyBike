# Park My Bike

Park My Bike is designed to allow users to share and view ratings on bike racks on City property, in Vancouver base on Crowdedness and Security.  If a user feels at a particular bike rack location is always full, he/she can create an account at Park My Bike, and rate the bike rack as crowded. If a user knows that a specific bike rack location is often stolen from, he/she can also log in and rate the location as unsafe. Through the power of crowdsourcing, the average rating for each category will be displayed when user selects a bike rack.

In addition, Park My Bike can display bike rack locations either on a map or in a list format, allowing users to conveniently discover new places to take their wheels. BikeParking also offers Facebook integration to allow users to link their accounts with Facebook, and share their comments on bike racks on their Facebook wall.

We will be following a "Feature branch" workflow to manage our work. This provides us with the ability to review other's commits before submitting to `master`, as well as to ensure that the `master` branch always represents the last "best" version of the team's effort.
